# 🏨 AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - Power BI

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past **20 years**. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are **losing its market share and revenue** in the luxury/business hotels category.

As a strategic move, the Managing Director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate **“Business and Data Intelligence”** in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their **Revenue Management Team** decided to hire a **third-party service provider** to provide them insights from their historical data.
